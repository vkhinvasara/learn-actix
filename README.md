# learn-actix
A repository to learn all the libraries which constitute to learn backend in Actix-Web.


Project 1: Minimalistic "Hello World" API

Goals:
Set up Actix Web project.
Define a simple HTTP route.
Return a plain text response.
Focus: Project structure, Actix Web's request/response handling.

Project 2: RESTful API (CRUD operations)
Goals:
Create endpoints for:
Creating data (POST)
Reading data (GET)
Updating data (PUT/PATCH)
Deleting data (DELETE)
Introduce a simple data store (in-memory for now).
Focus: HTTP methods, routing concepts, basic data modeling.

Project 3: API with Database Integration
Goals:
Choose a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite are good options).
Connect Actix Web to the database.
Replace the in-memory data store with database operations.
Focus: SQL or ORM usage, database connection management within Actix Web.

Project 4: User Authentication & Authorization
Goals:
Implement signup, login endpoints.
Introduce JWT (JSON Web Token) or session-based authentication.
Define user roles/permissions.
Protect certain API routes based on authorization.
Focus: Security concepts, token management, middleware usage in Actix Web.

Project 5: Real-Time Features with WebSockets
Goals:
Integrate WebSockets support into your Actix Web application.
Implement a simple chat room or live update functionality.
Focus: Understanding asynchronous programming, Actix Web's actor model for WebSocket communication.

Project 6: Full-Stack Web App (Choice of Frontend)
Goals
Select a frontend framework: React, Vue, Angular, or simpler options like Svelte.
Structure project for clear separation between backend and frontend.
Design frontend components to interact with your Actix Web API.
Focus: Full-stack development, API design for frontend consumption, potential use of state management on the frontend.
